WadingPool generated CN-Zygosity plot.
Red = Lowest HMM zygosity state, typically LOH, Blue = Heterozygous+ states.
HMM model fit to heterozygous counts for a target SNP set (typically dbSNP); the number of hidden states is inferred from a CN seg file and then reduced until the number of total states across the genome is lower than a set limit.
